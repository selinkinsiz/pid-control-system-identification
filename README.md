System Identification and PID Controller Design using MATLAB and Simulink

## Project Overview
This project focuses on system identification and PID controller design using measured response data. The objective was to model the system dynamics and improve performance through closed-loop control.

## Dataset
The dataset includes measured time and output response values used for system identification. The data was processed and modeled to obtain a transfer function representation of the system.

## Methodology
- Loaded measured response dataset (.mat file)
- Performed system identification to estimate system transfer function
- Designed and tuned a PID controller
- Analyzed system performance in time-domain
- Compared open-loop and closed-loop responses

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Control System Toolbox
- Simulink

## Repository Structure
- data/ → Measured dataset used for identification
- code/ → MATLAB scripts for modeling and controller design
- report/ → Full project report

## Results
The designed PID controller improved system stability, reduced steady-state error, and optimized transient response characteristics such as overshoot and settling time.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened practical understanding of system modeling, control theory, and controller tuning techniques in a simulation-based environment.
